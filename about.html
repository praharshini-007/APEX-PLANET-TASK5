    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm praharshini, a passionate Web Developer and Data Science enthusiast from Chennai. I love building modern web apps and working on AI projects.</p>
    <p>Hello, I’m praharshini — a passionate web developer and AI enthusiast from Chennai, India.</p>
<p>My journey into tech began with curiosity and evolved into a deep commitment to creating impactful digital solutions.</p>
<p>I specialize in building clean, responsive, and accessible websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With a strong foundation in AI and Data Science, I enjoy merging intelligent systems with beautiful interfaces.</p>
<p>I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and actively working on multiple AI internships.</p>
<p>Over the last year, I’ve completed several hands-on projects, ranging from simple portfolio sites to AI-powered chatbots.</p>
<p>I believe that good design is invisible, and great interfaces should make users feel at home instantly.</p>
<p>My coding philosophy is: write clean, reusable code that stands the test of time and scale.</p>
<p>I’ve worked extensively with Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Machine Learning libraries to build scalable data pipelines.</p>
<p>On the web development side, I love creating dynamic interfaces with modern JavaScript and CSS frameworks.</p>
<p>Whether it's building dashboards or deploying NLP apps, I focus on both performance and usability.</p>
<p>Recently, I built an intelligent chatbot called JuJu that answers questions using NLP and custom intents.</p>
<p>I’ve also created a Medical Diagnosis AI that predicts conditions using deep learning and CNN models.</p>
<p>One of my core goals is to make AI more accessible through elegant and intuitive web apps.</p>
<p>Outside of code, I’m deeply fascinated by user psychology and how micro-interactions influence digital behavior.</p>
<p>I’m also a firm believer in open-source and love sharing my work on GitHub to help others learn.</p>
<p>My GitHub journey has helped me stay accountable, collaborate globally, and build a strong professional presence.</p>
<p>I enjoy optimizing code and reducing bundle sizes — performance is just as important as design.</p>
<p>When not coding, I love writing tech blogs to share what I learn in simple and engaging language.</p>
<p>I also enjoy exploring different tools like Figma for UI planning and Git for version control.</p>
<p>One of my favorite achievements is creating a chatbot UI that mirrors real-time messaging apps with animation.</p>
<p>I also recently built a personal portfolio with a beautiful hero section, lazy-loading assets, and cross-browser support.</p>
<p>For me, learning never stops. Every project brings something new and exciting to master.</p>
<p>I'm currently exploring Next.js and React to move toward more scalable frontend architectures.</p>
<p>My dream is to contribute to real-world healthcare AI tools that save time and lives.</p>
